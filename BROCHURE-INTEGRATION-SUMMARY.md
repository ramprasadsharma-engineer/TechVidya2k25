# 🎉 Brochure Integration - Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Done

Your TechVidya 2025 portfolio now has **full brochure integration**! Users can click "Know More" on any event card and jump directly to that event's page in the brochure.

## 🚀 How It Works

When a user clicks "Know More" on an event card:
1. The brochure opens in a **new tab** (your portfolio stays open)
2. The brochure **automatically scrolls** to that specific event's page
3. User can read full details, rules, and information about the event

## 🔗 Example Links

- **Hackathon** → `https://techvidya-2025-brochure.pages.dev/#page-canvas-3`
- **Free Fire** → `https://techvidya-2025-brochure.pages.dev/#page-canvas-5`
- **Mark-King** → `https://techvidya-2025-brochure.pages.dev/#page-canvas-35`

## 📊 Stats

- ✅ **33 events** mapped to their brochure pages
- ✅ **35 pages** in the brochure (Page 1 = Cover, Page 2 = Index)
- ✅ **100% coverage** - every event has a working "Know More" link
- ✅ **Tested** and verified working

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

1. **Test it locally**: Run `npm run dev` and click "Know More" on any event
2. **Deploy**: Push to production and your users will have instant access to full event details
3. **Update anytime**: See `BROCHURE-INTEGRATION.md` for instructions on updating page numbers

## 📁 Files Modified

## 🎨 User Experience

    ↓
[New Tab Opens]
    ↓

```

## 💡 Pro Tip

The brochure URL format is: `https://techvidya-2025-brochure.pages.dev/#page-canvas-X`

Where X is the page number. The `#page-canvas-X` part makes the browser automatically scroll to that page!
